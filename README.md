### **Introduction: Structuring of API**

- `api_template:` Contains all the API related Code Base.

  - `manage.py:` Only entry point for API. Contains no logic.
  - `.env:` Most important file for your api and contains global configs. Acoid using application/variable level configs here.
  - `application:` It contains all your api related codes and test modules. I prefer keeping application folder at global.
  - `logs`: Logs is self-explanatory. FYI it will not contain any configuration information, just raw logs. Feel free to move according to your comfort but not inside the application folder.
  - `models:` As a part of Machine-Learning/ Deep-Learning app you might need to add model files here or if you have huge files on cloud add symlinks if possibles.
  - `resources:` To store any documentation, application related csv/txt/img files etc.
  - `settings:` Logger/DataBase/Model global settings files in yaml/json format.

- `application:`
  - `main:` priority folder of all your application related code.
    - `üèó infrastructure:` Data Base and ML/DL models related backbone code
    - `üìÆ routers:` API routers and they strictly do not contain any business logic
    - `üì° services:` All processing and business logic for routers here at service layer
    - `‚öí utility:`
      - `config_loader` Load all application related config files from settings directory
      - `logger` Logging module for application
      - `manager` A manager utility for Data Related Task which can be common for different services
    - `üêç config.py:` Main config of application, inherits all details from .env file
  - `test:` Write test cases for your application here.
  - `initializer.py:` Preload/Initialisation of Models and Module common across application. Preloading model improves inferencing.

### Running Locally ? üìç

    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt

        python scripts/download_models.sh

        uvicorn manage:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

    ```
    OR
    ```bash
        bash scripts/run.sh
    ```

    Import the API collection into insomnia, and Test it üöÄ

### Docker Support üê≥

    ```bash
        docker build -t fastapi-image  .
        docker run -d --name fastapi-container -p 8000:8000 fastapi-image
    ```

### Download Image Models

    ```bash
        bash scripts/download_models.sh
    ```

**Notes:** If results include drinking or eating, then the person in the video is probably taking a drug.

**WARNING:** The model is crappy and not accurate
